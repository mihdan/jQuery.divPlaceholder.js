jQuery.divPlaceholder.js
========================
A mostly-CSS-with-a-bit-of-jQuery plugin to emulate the `placeholder` attribute for `contenteditable` divs.

The placeholder text is added via a CSS psuedo-element, so it won't appear in the div content.

Usage
-----

See the `demo/demo.html` page for an example.

Reference the JS and CSS files as usual.

Add a `data-placeholder='Your default text'` attribute to your div.
